# Rick and Morty Detective

This repository contains an implementation of a Gan Neural network used for anomaly detection.

This repository doesn't contain standalone software but it is meant to work with Alpha-I's Watson and ADS for Aerospace project.

This is possible because the model is wrapped in a class which implements a Detective Interface
